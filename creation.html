    <h2>The First Owners</h2>
    <p>The original owners of the Lakers were Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen, who were also the owners of the Minneapolis Lakers.</p>
    <p>In 1960, the team was sold to Jack Kent Cooke, who moved the franchise to Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>Under Cooke's ownership, the Lakers continued to thrive, attracting star players and winning championships.</p>
    <p>But the owner who influenced the Lakers to this day was Jerry Buss.</p>
    <p>In 1979, Buss purchased the Lakers and transformed the team into a global brand.</p>
    <p>He was known for his innovative marketing strategies and his ability to attract top talent to the team.</p>
    <p>Under Buss's ownership, the Lakers won multiple championships and became one of the most successful franchises in NBA history.</p>
    <p>After Buss's passing in 2013, his family took over ownership of the team, with his daughter Jeanie Buss serving as the team's president and controlling owner.</p>
    <p>The Buss family continues to uphold Jerry Buss's legacy and commitment to excellence, ensuring that the Lakers remain a dominant force in the NBA.</p>
